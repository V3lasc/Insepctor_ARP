<img src='Dom_DiPierro.jpg' width='40%'>

This program will help detect ARP poisoning attacks from a threat actor.

I would like to give credit to [saintvic20](https://github.com/saintvic20/ARP-SPOOF-DETECTOR) during my research on creating this tool.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/V3lasc/Inspector_ARP.git
cd Inspector_ARP
python Inspector_ARP
```
